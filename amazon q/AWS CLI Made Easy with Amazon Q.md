# AWS CLI Made Easy with Amazon Q

The AWS CLI is _massive_! By my count, [AWS CLI v2](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/index.html) includes 392 base level commands. That number seemed so astronomical to me that I double and triple checked it and yet it doesn't include subcommands and option flags. 

While you are unlikely to ever need to work with every service in AWS that these commands relate to, even a subset of commands for the services you do interact would still likely encompass a large list of commands, subcommands and available options. On the upside, LocalStack's [AWS CLI wrapper](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/) doesn't require that you learn any new commands or options since it just redirects existing commands to the locally hosted services.

If you, like me, have not memorized all the relevant commands and options that you need to work with, I have some good news. [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/), Amazon's generative AI assistant, has a CLI integration that can be a huge help in generating the commands you need without requiring any memorization. Let's look at how to get it set up, how to use it and how to adapt the generated commands for LocalStack.

## What Is Amazon Q for the Command Line?

[Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) (formerly CodeWhisperer) is an AI assistant for coding similar to GitHub Copilot. It can do things like code suggestions within your editor, offer chat-based coding help, or even write/modify your code for you. If you've used an AI coding assistant before, these are all the sorts of features you'd expect.

However, it also includes a full set of command line functionality including hinting, chat and a translate feature that can take natural language and turn it into command line commands. As we'll see, these features can be incredibly useful for speeding up your command line usage (especially if you, like me, aren't necessarily a command line expert).

Unfortunately, at this time, Amazon Q for the Command Line is only available on MacOS.
